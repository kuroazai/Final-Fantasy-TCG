## WIP Teaching AI to play TCG games with NLP & OpenAI


## Introduction
Goal of this project is to get an AI to understand the rules of a TCG game, in this instance the final fantasy TCG. This requires some data collection which will be done via the offical resource by downloading the card images which will be used later on with computer vision to understand what the particular card does and how the AI can assess a game board. The if everything goes according to plan should have an AI agent that can successfully generate strategies/combos based off the board, deck and resources.
